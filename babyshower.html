			<h3>Goal</h3>
			<p>This was my main project for my Web Design class with General Assembly. I took advantage of the opportunity to craft a working site for use in planning a good friend's baby shower. My goal for this site was to make it as easy as possible to navigate the site on a mobile device, with the idea that many attendees would use the site on the day of for GPS navigation, with the contact information and embedded Google Maps.</p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>I designed the site with HTML and CSS and used media queries to make it fully responsive. Honestly, I was a little concerned that no one had seen the link to the site in the invite that was sent out by the person organizing the event. However, many attendees said that they used it and were glad to have it, "because it's usually impossible to keep all the important info in one place!"</p>
