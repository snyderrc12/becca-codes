			<h3>Client Goal</h3>
			<p>The client wanted to update his website, which was hosted on a drag and drop website. His goal was to appeal to a younger generation, and have his new website showcase his work and direct the user towards purchasing his albums, and clearly lay out his tour dates.</p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>I designed and updated the website on the existing medium and hosting site, adding custom HTML elements. To modernize the site, I used large high-quality images and prominently incorporated the links to social media and his blog. I put links to his newest album on the front page, as well as created a store page with easy links to the most popular websites where young people buy their music.</p>
			<h3>Stefan Says:</h3>
			<p>"I was privileged to work with Rebecca Snyder recently. She transformed my website into an inspiring and uplifting place. The comments I receive all testify to the excellent work of Ms.Snyder. In addition it was a great pleasure to work with her. She is a professional with the skills to work with people in a most encouraging way. I heartily commend Rebecca Snyder to all who wish to enhance their presence on the web." -Stefan Andre Waligur, composer, retreat leader.</p>
